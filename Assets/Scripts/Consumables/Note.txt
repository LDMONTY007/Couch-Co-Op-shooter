Consumables take up the lowest slot in the UI.
They are items that can only be consumed by the player holding them. You can give them to other players, however, if those players have an empty consumable slot.
Ex. Healing potion (gives health that degrades over time), or speed potion (makes all actions have a small speed multiplier, including movement, reloading, and applying consumeables or appliables).
